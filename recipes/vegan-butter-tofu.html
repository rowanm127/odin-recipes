        <li>Coconut milk (400g)</li>
        <li>Coconut oil (Can be substituted with other cooking oils)</li>
        <li>Cornstarch</li>
        <li>Cumin</li>
        <li>Curry Powder</li>
        <li>Garam Masala</li>
        <li>Garlic (4 cloves)</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Ground corriander</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Tofu (800g)</li>
        <li>Tomato purée (170g)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Optional</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Naan bread</li>
        <li>Rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>If serving with rice, start cooking now, and cover to keep warm when finished.</li>
        <li>To prep the tofu, preheat oven to 220&deg;C. Drain the tofu, wrap in a clean towel and set something heavy on it for around 20 minutes (if you have a tofu press use that). Pat dry and tear into bite-sized chunks.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine 2 Tbsp of cornstarch and 1 tsp each of curry powder and salt. Toss in the tofu and gently stir to evenly coat.</li>
        <li>Arrange tofu on a greased baking sheet and cook for 25 to 30 minutes, flipping each piece halfway through cooking. You can leave the tofu in longer for a chewier texture.</li>
        <li>While the tofu cooks, heat 2 Tbsp of oil in a large pan or pot over medium heat. Add 1 medium sized onion and cook, stirring often, until the onion is soft and translucent, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>To create the flavour base, stir in 1 Tbsp freshly grated ginger and 4 cloves of garlic (minced), continue cooking for 1 minute. Stir in 1 Tbsp garam masala, 1tsp ground corriander seed, 1 tsp chili powder, and &frac12; tsp each salt and cumin.</li>
        <li>Now for the sauce. Stir in the coconut milk and tomato purée. Cover and gently simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, to reduce the acidity from the tomato purée. It should look dark orange when done. Optionally blend the sauce to make it even smoother.</li>
        <li>Spoon the crispy tofu into the sauce and serve warm with either naan or rice.</li>
    </ol>
